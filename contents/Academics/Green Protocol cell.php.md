“Green Protocol is based on three principles—reduce, reuse and recycle. Green protocol is essentially a set of measures which when implemented results in significant reduction of waste with primary focus on prevention of use of disposables and using reusable alternatives like glass/stainless/porcelain cutleries.
</p>
<p>    Avoid the use of all types of disposables (including plastic, paper) in daily life.<br/>
   Always use cups and containers that can be washed and reused instead of those made of plastic or paper.<br/>
   Avoid banned plastic materials; follow government rules in this regard.<br/>
   Segregate bio and non-bio degradable; compost bio degradable at source using simple and appropriate composting devices.<br/>
   Keep the non-bio degradable clean and dry and store separately based the type; hand it over to local body systems or scrap dealer for recycling.<br/>
   Avoid ‘use and throw’ carry bags. Always use bags made of eco-friendly materials.<br/>
   Always use cloth banners instead of flex.<br/>
   Use bamboo baskets or ones made of eco-friendly materials instead of plastic waste baskets.<br/>
   Always use eco-friendly materials like leaves flowers etc for decoration and while making bouquets for felicitating guests.<br/>
