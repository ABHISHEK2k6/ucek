#### Collaboration With Industry

University College of Engineering Kariavattom is now providing a serene environment and congenial atmosphere for learning. The institution not only provides quality engineering education to mould the students into technologically sound, efficient, effective, and creative engineers but also moulds them as responsible human beings.

UCEK welcomes all industry partners who seek practicable and pragmatic solutions, and who share and celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit that brings new ideas to life. Together, UCEK and industry can make great progress in creating new knowledge, in shaping new leaders and in making important gains against the challenges of our generation. The industry- institute collaboration will help in exchanging the academic knowledge and the practical experience of industry. The academic institution needs skill development and the industry needs academic knowledge.

Hence we are interested in developing good relationship with the industry for exchanging knowledge and practical experience.

By this industry- institute collaboration, students can visit the industry and learn the current skills used by the industry. Also, the students will be trained by the experts in the industry. The students will be sent for internship to the companies so that they can gain industry exposure. The industry people will be invited to give guest lecturers periodically. This exchange will ultimately help in developing the country both academically and industrially.
