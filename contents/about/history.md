HISTORY
<h3>Our University</h3>

Sir. C P Ramaswamy Ayyar, the then Diwan of the state, was the first Vice-Chancellor. It was the sixteenth University to be set up in India and ten colleges within the state of Travancore which were affiliated to the Madras University became the affiliated colleges of the University of Travancore.</p>
<p>In 1957, the Kerala University Act, Act 14 of 1957, was brought into force and the University of Travancore was renamed University of Kerala.
