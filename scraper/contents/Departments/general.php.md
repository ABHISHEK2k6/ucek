<br/><h2 style="text-transform:uppercase;">General Departments </h2>
<p>The General Department was started in the year 2000 comprising different departments like mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. Along with the main streams, a relevant study of core engineering branches and basic sciences are essential for engineering students. This Department of first year engineering aims to help the students to develop strong fundamentals in all basic courses. First year engineering is the beginning of a professional career therefore the department is very cautious about the teaching learning process and overall result of the students. Apart from the regular classes, the department also offers remedial classes for first year students who find it difficult to cope up with their studies. The department also caters to the overall development of the students through orientation programs, bridge courses, and personality development programs.</p>
<p>The department has a team of well qualified, experienced and highly motivated faculty members devoted to the overall development of the students. As a supporting department, the faculty cooperates in all curricular and extracurricular activities also.</p>
