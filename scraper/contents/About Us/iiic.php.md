<h2>Industry Institute Interaction Cell </h2>
<p> Interaction between the Industry and Institute is an essential one. The Industry-Institution Interaction Cell(IIIC) was established to strengthen the relationship between industry and our institute, which provides an excellent platform for both the students as well as the faculty members to be aware of industry expectations from the graduates. IIIC serves as a podium to showcase the best practices, latest technologies in industry stand point and their implementation.</p>
<p>Also, IIIC promotes industry experts to continuously partake in curriculum design and career development programs which play a significant role in honing the skill set of the students inclined towards the expectation of the industry. Towards up scaling the academia in the Global knowledge index, ample industrial exposure is provided to the faculty members to enhance the Teaching Learning Process and enable the Institution to produce quality students in turn. </p>
