DEVELOPER STUDENT CLUB
<p>UCK-DSC was officially inaugurated by Dr.Z.A.Samitha, Principal of the University College of Engineering by launching its website at the Golden Jubilee Auditorium on 1st November 2017 in the presence of various officials from the University of Kerala.  Mrs. Meharuniza Nazeem, mentor of UCK-DSC officially declared the motive behind the club. .</p>
<p>The first event to be organized by the club was a workshop on “LINUX Migration &amp; GIT”, two tools every aspiring coder needs in his arsenal. The programme, which saw an attendance of about 60 students, was conducted by final year CSE students at the Seminar Hall of the University College of Engineering on 21st October 2017.  This project was implemented by a team of members Mr. Niyas, Mr. Arjun Sreekumar, Mr. Ajmal, Mr. Abhiragh and  Sri. Syam Sasankan, AP, CSE, Meharuniza Nazeem ,Assistant Professor, Dept. of Information Technology </p>
<p>The club collaborated with the Sophisticated Instrumentation and Computation Centre(SICC) of the Kerala University to develop a responsive workflow management software ‘EKA’,built on Django that helped reduce paper trails within the departments of the Karyavattom Campus of the Kerala University and can be accessed remotely from anywhere in the campus. It enabled the printing of records and maintaining information about tasks being performed at any time. This helped to do away with all difficulties involved with assigning tasks between departments.This project was implemented by a team of members Mr. Niyas, Mr. Arjun Sreekumar, Mr. Ajmal, Mr. Abhiragh and  Sri. Syam Sasankan, AP, CSE, Meharuniza Nazeem ,Assistant Professor, Dept. of Information Technology</p><br/>
<p>The Indian History Congress held at the Karyavattom campus of the University of Kerala towards the end of 2016 in the presence of the Hon. President of India was a source of pride for both the city and the campus. A team from the UCK DSC was responsible for the official mobile applications on both Android &amp; iOS that aided the delegates who graced the occasion by providing details of ongoing and scheduled events through push notifications.
<p>The service of UCK DSC was instrumental in the revival of the library of Dept. of Music, Kerala University by digitising the working of the library. Students from the club also conducted training programmes on “KOHA library management software”.
<p>UCKSC’s new routine is based on the idea of knowledge sharing in a manner most appealing to the students.Two minor meet-ups are planned for each month on various technical topics where club members can share their knowledge. This will help the others to learn the basics of their fields of interest and act as a platform for them to build upon for a future career. The first of these meet-ups on the topic of “Web Designing” was held at the college premises on 6th Jan 2018. 
<p>Meetups and seminars are already being organized for the next few months along with a number of workshops to increase interest in computer science associated fields.
